  <h2 id="overlapping">How do I fix overlapping item elements?</h2>

  <p>If your layout has images, you probably need to use <a href="appendix.html#imagesloaded">imagesLoaded</a>.</p>

  <p>Overlaping items are caused by items that change size after a layout. This is caused by unloaded media: images, <a href="appendix.html#web-fonts">web fonts</a>, embedded buttons. To fix it, you need to initialize or <a href="methods.html#layout"><code>layout</code></a> after all the items have their proper size.</p>

  <h2 id="browser-support">What is Masonry&rsquo;s browser support?</h2>

  <p>Masonry works in IE8+ and modern browsers, including mobile browsers on iOS and Android.</p>

  <h2 id="difference-between-isotope-and-masonry">What is the difference between Isotope, Masonry, and Packery?</h2>

  <p>Isotope, <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com">Masonry</a>, and <a href="http://packery.metafizzy.co">Packery</a> are all similar in that they are layout libraries. Many of their options and methods are the same.</p>

  <p>Masonry does cascading grid &ldquo;masonry&rdquo; layouts. Packery does bin-packing layouts, which allow it to be used for <a href="http://packery.metafizzy.co/draggable.html">draggable interactions</a>.</p>

  <p>Isotope does sorting and filtering. Isotope uses masonry layouts, as well as other layouts. </p>

  <p>Masonry is licensed MIT and is freely available for use and distribution. Isotope and Packery have a proprietary license, where you can purchase a license for commercial projects, or use it freely for open-source projects.</p>

<h2 id="first-item-breaks-grid">The first item breaks the grid!</h2>

<p>You most likely need to set the <a href="masonry.html#columnwidth"><code>columnWidth</code> option</a> for <a href="masonry.html">masonry layout mode</a>. Without <code>columnWidth</code> set, the masonry layout mode will use the width of the first item for the size of its columns.</p>

``` js
$('#container').isotope({
  masonry: {
    columnWidth: 200
  }
});
```
