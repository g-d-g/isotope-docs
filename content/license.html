<p>Isotope may be used in commercial projects and applications with the one-time purchase of a commercial license.</p>

<h3>Open source license</h3>

<p>For non-commercial, personal, or open source projects and applications, you may use Isotope under the terms of the <a href="http://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-v3/">GPL v3 License</a>. You may use Isotope for free.</p>

<h3>What is commercial considered?</h3>

<p>If you are paid to do your job, and part of your job is implementing Isotope, a commercial license is required.</p>

<p>Purchasing takes seconds and accepts credit cards or PayPal. Once purchased, you&rsquo;ll receive a commercial license PDF and you will be all set to use Isotope in your commercial applications.</p>

<p>With the purchase of a commercial license:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may use Isotope in as many commercial applications you like.</li>
  <li>You may use Isotope in your own commercial applications and products. For example: premium WordPress, Tumblr, or other CMS themes, plugins and templates.</li>
  <li>Customers and users of your products do <strong>not</strong> need to purchase their own license &mdash; so long as they are not developing their own commercial products with Isotope.</li>
</ul>

<p>The commercial license comes in two varieties:</p>

<h3>Isotope Commercial Developer License</h3>

<div class="row">
  <div class="cell">
    <p>The Isotope Commercial Developer License is for individual developers. This license is priced per developer. Each individual developer needs to purchase a separate license. A developer is someone who implements Isotope, and probably types <code>.isotope()</code> at some point.</p>
